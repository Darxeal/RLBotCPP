# RLBotCPP

C++ client for the [RLBot framework](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot).

## How to use:

- Use cmake to generate the solution.
- Build the executable.
- Copy the latest dll files from the RLBot pip package to the executable folder.
- Start a Rocket League match by running run.bat.
- Start the C++ bot executable.

## NOTES:

This is very much work in progress. Only supports running one bot on a hardcoded index.
